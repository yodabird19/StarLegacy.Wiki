__ _Worlds_ __
Andromeda Sector 7b (which is where StarLegacy takes place) contains 15 planets around four stars. A list of them ensues below.

__Sobrii System__
The Sobrii System is the planetary system that new players spawn into, and is also the most populated system. Boasting four planets and a rich asteroid belt, Sobrii is a great destination for new and old players alike. Though Sobrii is not known for its native resources (with the possible exception of the planet Quod Canis), there are still a number of reasons one might call Sobrii home.

Aecor:
[IMAGE]
Aecor is an archipelago the size of a planet. Being mostly ocean, space on Aecor is at a premium. Aecor is a source of [---]. Aecor is a fairly capable growing planet (growth rate 80 for all plants), and there is little land left without a claim.

Collis:
[IMAGE]
Collis is a fractured, hilly planet, with oceans thousands of blocks wide, which co-exist with thin lava rivers. Collis is a source of [---]. Collis is a very strong growing planet (growth rate 90 for all plants except Nether Wart, which is only 30), but beware the spiders that come out at night!

Trunkandis:
[IMAGE]
Trunkandis is composed of a single, planet-spanning jungle that covers half of the planet, and a vast ocean covering the other half. Trunkandis is a rather difficult planet to set up a settlement on, due to the rugged terrain and gigantic jungle trees. Trunkandis is a source of [---]. Trunkandis is [INSERT GROWING INFO HERE], and is, as the Jungle biome is in Vanilla Minecraft, the only native home of numerous resources!

Quod Canis:
[IMAGE]
Quod Canis is a unique, lively planet, composed mostly of land, with oceans and lakes interspersed throughout. Quod Canis is a source of Coal, Iron, Wood, and is an excellent source of Chetherite, being that Chetherite is only found either in asteroids or on Quod Canis. Quod Canis is an excellent growing planet (Growth rate 95 for all plants except Nether Wart, which is only 30), and has a surprising amount of unclaimed land.

__Frigus System__
The Frigus System is the second most populated system, and the coldest. Though a number of its planets are not habitable, they are still inhabited thanks to Frigus’s plentiful mining resources.

Koryza:
[IMAGE]
Koryza is the innermost planet of the Frigus system, the only planet in the system with an ocean, and the only one that has any natural life. Koryza is a source of [---]. Koryza is a strong growing planet (growth rate 90 for all plants except Nether Wart, which is only 30), and is a good destination for players who want to live in the Frigus system (home to some of the best mining planets on StarLegacy) but want a habitable and safe world nonetheless.

Cerus Beta:
[IMAGE]
Cerus Beta is a strange world, with low gravity and a cragged landscape, with no oceans. Cerus Beta is a source of [---]. Cerus Beta is a very weak growing planet (growth rate 30 for all plants except Nether Wart, which is 40), but is the only source of Chorus Fruits and Endstone. Aside from its End-like resources, Cerus Beta frankly has little to offer.

Orcus:
[IMAGE]
Orcus is an icy, cold planet, with massive trenches which expose the lava ocean beneath criss-crossing the landscape. Orcus is a source of [---], a fairly strong mining planet so long as you don’t fall into the lava. Orcus is a mediocre growing planet at best (growth rate 50 for all planets except Nether Wart, which is 30), and is fairly well-inhabited, with some residents even living on platforms atop the lava oceans!

Syre:
[IMAGE]
Syre is an extremely cold planet, but is also considered the best mining planet in Andromeda Sector 7b. Syre is a source of iron, redstone, lapis lazuli, diamonds, aluminum, [INSERT THE REST]. Syre’s farming capabilities are identical to Orcus (growth rate 50 for all plants except Nether Wart, which is 30), as they are both not very strong. Due to its plentiful, good ores, Syre is a big destination for people who are out to make money, though few people actually live on Syre. As long as you keep your space suit on (it is very cold), Syre is surprisingly safe (no mobs or lava). 

__Centrum System__
The Centrum System is the system closest to the center of Andromeda Sector 7b, and is the third most populated. Centrum is the only system with a number of planets other than four (three), and also acts as an awkwardly large gravity well which occasionally interrupts hyperspatial flights between Sobrii and Ignum.

Titus:
[IMAGE]
Titus is a concrete-covered, oceanless, mountainous, and also radioactive planet, and is thus difficult to live on. However, many players do anyway, most commonly because Titus is the best source of Uranium, which is the best fuel item in StarLegacy. Titus is a source of Uranium, Coal, and Redstone. Titus is a [-] growing planet ([--]), and, due to radioactivity, requires a space suit be worn at all times.

Arbusto:
[IMAGE]
Arbusto is a lively, forest-covered planet, with no ocean, but a lot of rivers. Arbusto has a lot of wildlife and biomass, being covered in trees and chickens. Arbusto is a source of [---]. Arbusto is the best growing planet (growth rate 100 for all plants), and is well known for such. Players seeking to farm flock to Arbusto for rapid growth and plentiful resources. However, while Arbusto is great for maintaining a modest existence, it does not have intrinsic to itself many rare resources, it simply has a lot more of the common ones. A player who lives on Arbusto should be prepared to leave the planet often if they want to make any money.

Sakaro:
[IMAGE]
Sakaro is a strange, lake-dotted world, a planet whose land is covered in a forest of pink trees, flowers, and variable ground. Sakaro is a source of [---]. Sakaro is a [-] growing planet ([--]), and is avoided by many players due to a violent, pirate-filled history.

__Ignum System__
The Ignum System is the least populated system, and the hottest. Ignum is not very inhabited due to a semi-remote location and overheated worlds, however some brave players have set up settlements in this system, and have thus gained access to large amounts of terrain due to a lack of competing settlements.

Cerus Alpha:
[IMAGE]
Cerus Alpha is considered by many to be the most inhospitable world in Andromeda Sector 7b. Cerus Alpha has no natural food sources, nor is it capable of growing any very fast. It is home to a massive ocean of lava, as well as rivers criss-crossing the land. Cerus Alpha is a source of [---]. Cerus Alpha is a very weak growing planet (growth rate 30 for all plants except Nether Wart, which is 100), and, due to heat, requires a space suit be worn at all times.

Harenum:
[IMAGE]
Harenum is a desert/mesa planet with no oceans, and elevation differences that can span most of the way between bedrock level and the sky limit. Harenum is a source of [---]. Harenum is an abysmal growing planet (growth rate 20 for all plants except Nether Wart, which is 30), but is visited by many nonetheless due to having a good share of resources. 

Terram:
[IMAGE]
Terram is a warm planet with numerous biomes represented in it, from deserts to mesas to swamplands. Terram is a source of [---]. Terram is a somewhat capable growing planet (growth rate 75 for all plants except Mushroom, which is 80, and Nether Wart, which is 30), and is the most-inhabited planet in the Ignum system.

Porrus:
[IMAGE]
Porrus is a strange, bilayered planet, with large swamps above, and massive mushroom caves below. Porrus is a source of [---]. Porrus is a modest growing planet (growth rate 65 for all plants except Nether Wart, which is 30), and is the coldest and most life-covered planet in the Ignum system, above and below.
